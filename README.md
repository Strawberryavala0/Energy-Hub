## About
EnergyHub’s mission is to “empower utilities and their customers to create a clean, distributed energy future.” 

EnergyHub’s primary customers are electric utilities, who purchase the “Distributed Energy Resource Management System” (DERMS) software platform. The Mercury DERMS platform coordinates the behavior of more than 700,000 DERs, which are enrolled through more than 60 utility programs. 

One of the core features of the Mercury DERMS is that it gives utilities the ability to call “demand response” events in which the connected devices reduce their energy consumption during periods of peak electricity demand.  This allows utilities to reduce energy costs, carbon emissions and reduces the need to build new power plants.

Our team focused on demand response events, which are changes in the power consumption of an electric utility customer to better match the demand for power with the supply.

Potential factors influencing the timing and extent of these demand responses which the team will analyze include power costs, rates of emissions and availability of different power sources fueling the power grid.

We looked to optimize these demand response events to reduce carbon emissions from the power plants being used as much as possible.
